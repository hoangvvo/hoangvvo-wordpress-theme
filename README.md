# hoangvvo.com Wordpress Theme
A beautifully darken Wordpress Theme V1 for hoangvvo.com.
The Wordpress Theme was used for the second version 2.0 of my website at [hoangvvo.com](https://www.hoangvvo.com/)

## Features

This is personally made for **portfolio/personal website**. I used to use it for my personal website at [hoangvvo.com](https://www.hoangvvo.com/) until I moved on to GatsbyJS.

### Blog posts section

There is a blog section resides at `example.com/blog`. In order for a post to be a blog, it has to be tagged blog as one of the categories.

### Honors and Awards section

This resides at `example.com/honor`.

This is the place where you can show off your awards, recognition. Each award post can have a title, a description, the date, and an image (1:1 ratio recommended). If no image is supplied, a default image (which can be set from Theme Customizer) will be used as the fallback.

### About me section

Where you can write about yourself. Simply create a *page* named `about`.

## Notes

### Production-ready

You can use this for your personal website. However, this project is not-really production-ready as it is not very customizable and is very dependent on the environment setting of my Wordpress. You may want to tweak it first.

It is recommended to install several plugins mentioned in my blog post [How I tweak my Wordpress website for better SEO and faster speed](https://www.hoangvvo.com/blog/tweak-wordpress-for-better-seo-and-faster-speed/)

### Issues

If there is an issue, please file one [here](https://github.com/vvhoang/hoangvvo-wordpress-theme/issues). Several possible issues can be:
- *hard-coded contents*: uncustomizable contents on the site such as some headings, paragraphs, header, footer, *images*, alt tags, *my info*. For example, parts of the website may include my name, which they should not. The only place should my name be is in the footer's credit.
- *incompatibility*: as I mentioned, this theme is coded in a way that is very dependent on my specific environment.

Any contribution would be greatly appreciated.
